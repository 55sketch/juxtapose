Step 1.
To use TBD you need to provide two images showing the same place at two different times. The two images should ideally be taken from the same perspective and distance. This early version of TBD does not provide any way to help position your images. Once you have your two images picked, you need provide the direct link to each of the images. If your newsroom does not have a way to get a direct link to images, you can host your images on Flickr as well.
