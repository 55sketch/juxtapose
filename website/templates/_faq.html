          Absolutely not. TBD is friction-free. If you have the links to two images, you are ready to use TBD.

          <p>Yes, with some cautions. For some user roles, Wordpress "filters" HTML, stripping out the information that SoundCite needs to function. Specifically, for most Wordpress installs, only users with the <code>administrator</code> and <code>editor</code> roles will be able to enter SoundCite clips. Users with the <code>author</code> or <code>contributor</code> roles will have the SoundCite information stripped out of their posts. This will also happen if an <code>author</code> or <code>contributor</code> edits a post after an <code>administrator</code> or <code>editor</code>  has configured SoundCite. For more, see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#unfiltered_html">Roles and Capabilities</a> page of the Wordpress Codex.</p>
          <p>
            You can install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/">User Role Editor</a> plugin to grant the "unfiltered_html" capability to the "author" and "contributor" roles. There are risks involved in allowing less trusted users to author unfiltered HTML, so consider your own situation before choosing this solution.

            Details may be slightly different for Wordpress multiuser sites.

          TBD is designed with a minimalist style meant to work with most websites. If you want to customize the appearance, you can change most of how it looks with CSS rules. Right now it's hard to change the moving progress bar with CSS, which may make it hard to fit other custom styles in.
