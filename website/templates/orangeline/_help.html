                        <p>Unfortunately, Google has <a href='http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2015/08/deprecating-web-hosting-support-in.html' target='_blank'>deprecated web hosting in Google Drive</a>, which means that Zoomify images hosted on Google Drive. will no longer display. Dropbox has similary <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/help/16' target='_blank'>discontinued rendering content in public folders</a>, so this method will cause problems for many users as well.</p><p>We're working on a solution, but for right now the only other option seems to be hosting your images on a web server.</p>

                        To disable connecting lines on maps, use the StoryMap option: <code>Treat as Image</code> <em>(as opposed to the default, <code>Treat as Cartography</code>)</em>

                        <p>You can add a parameter to the URL that is the value of the iframe src attribute, <code>start_at_slide</code>.

                        <p>Choose <code>options</code> from the top left of the StoryMap window, then from the <code>map type</code> menu choose the type you like.</p> <p>Select <code>Mapbox</code> to enter the ID of your Mapbox map.</p> Select <code>custom</code> to enter the URL for a tile server. If the server supports multiple subdomains, enter them as a single string in the Subdomain field (e.g. subdomains 'a', 'b', and 'c' should be entered as 'abc').

                    <h3>How can I adjust the zoom?</h3>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>To keep it simple for most users, we've made some assumptions in the authoring tool which may not universally apply. For example, the first screen is always an <code>overview</code> slide. Also, the zoom is affected by the overall size of the map and the relationship between the current and previous points on the map.</p> <p>It's possible to download the configuration (a JSON file) that the authoring tool makes and edit the JSON yourself. You could then change the first slide to not be an <code>overview</code> and manually set a starting lat/lon/zoom.</p> <p>Be aware that switching back and forth between editing within and outside the authoring tool can get messy, so we suggest using our <a href='https://storymap.knightlab.com/advanced/'>advanced</a> method to have maximum control over the zoom feature and more.</p>
